This Python script demonstrates common list operations step-by-step, including creating an empty list, appending elements, inserting at a specific position, extending with another list, removing an element, sorting, and finding an index.

Steps Performed
Create an Empty List
An empty list called my_list is created.

Append Elements
Elements 10, 20, 30, and 40 are appended to the list.

Insert an Element
The value 15 is inserted at the second position (index 1).

Extend the List
Another list [50, 60, 70] is added to the end of my_list using .extend().

Remove the Last Element
The last element of the list is removed using .pop().

Sort the List
The list is sorted in ascending order.

Find an Element's Index
The index of the value 30 is found and printed.
